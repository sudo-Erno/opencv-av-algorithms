### Adding a New Algorithm

1. To add a new algorithm to this collection, create a folder with the algorithm name. Each folder should be self-contained. All dependencies must be included within the folder along with the user-created code.

2. Each downloadable folder should have everything necessary to run it (including build/run instructions).

3. Code sections must be extensively documented/commented. It is not necessary to comment on every line, but sections of code instead so other developers may understand the code clearly.

4. Tests are not necessary for the time-being, but encouraged.
